![interface](./eat-n-split.png)

**Eat & Split** is a smart, simple web app that helps you split bills fairly with friends after eating out, partying, or hanging out.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I’m a self-taught frontend developer learning React — and this project was born from a common frustration I’ve experienced personally:

> "We went out... Who paid? Who owes what?"

So I built a solution: **Eat & Split**.

- 💰 Enter a bill, split expenses by who paid
- ⚖️ Instantly calculate how much each person owes
